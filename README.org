Shaker: Launch Salt Minions as Amazon EC2 Instances

Release v##.##.# (Installation)

Shaker is BSD-New Licensed command-line application, written in Python

Salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
administer servers in a fast and efficient way.

Running an Amazon EC2 instance as a Salt minion is fairly simple.
Also tedious, if you need to launch minions often.  Shaker bridges
the gap between launching an EC2 instance and bootstrapping it as
a Salt minion.

Shaker is invoked from the command line:

$ shaker --distro ubuntu --master salt.example.com

Creates an small ubuntu server instance as a salt minion and
registers it with the salt master at salt.example.com.
